## Disclaimer
The game is a prototipe, so it misses some features. The fundmental gameplay mechanics are all implemented and fully functioning, so the prototipe is playable.
## Introduction
Space Rolls 0x52454D414B45 is a remake done from scratch of Space Rolls, a 3D platform game that I and a friend developed in 3 days without any experience for a game jam in 2022. The game revolves around a robot which has to jump on colored platforms, 
and the player's job is to collect all the coins placed on the platform without falling into the abyss of space. To make it interesting, we added a giant stage in which a giant colored cube is thrown, deciding the color of the platform on which the 
robot could jump safely; in fact, the other ones would disappear after a few moments. Of course, the color of each platform changes at every roll of the cube. Though I am deeply attached to the original game, I'm aware it was a mess: it worked, but had 
so many flaws. During university, in 2023, I really wanted to challenge myself and improve my game dev skills, so I decided to remake the game solo in few months. It was difficult to me to make a game while studying and that's the reason I never finished the project, nonotheless I managed to implement all the main game mechanics. I also decided to change the game balancing compared to the original game adding more platforms to jump on, introducing game waves (which become faster and faster) and fixing problems 
related to the roll of the cube and the distribution of the colors across the platforms for each roll.
